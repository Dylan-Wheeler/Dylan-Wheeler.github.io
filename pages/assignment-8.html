			<h1>Assignment 8</h1>
			<p class="assignment-description">
                I chose to play through the game "Gravity Bone" and describe the actions that I took while playing the game.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                1. First, I entered the exit room to the right of the starting position and attempted to click the red button which was unresponsive.<br>
                <br>
                2. Next I went up the stairs and noticed that waiters were coming from a room to the left and so I entered it<br>
                <br>
                3. I saw the sign for the furnace room which was on the card I was given so I entered.<br>
                <br>
                4. In the furnace room, after jumping over the furnace itself I saw a briefcase which upon opening gave me a waiter's uniform and a drink with the new instructions to give that drink to a red haired man.<br>
                <br>
                5. Upon leaving the furnace room I accidentaly jumped over the railing and died so I reloaded my save back in the furnace room.<br>
                <br>
                6. From here, I headed up the stairs and gave the dink to the man with red hair on the above balcony who then burped up some green gas (presumably poison).<br>
                <br>
                7. Now the game told me to find the exit so I attempted to jump from the upper balcony down to the lower level, unsuccessfully.<br>
                <br>
                8. Once I reloaded my save, I proceeded down the stairs back to the exit room that I had previously visited and clicked the red button which ended the level with a cutscene about some bug where I then recieved some money.<br>
                <br>
                9. Now we move on to the second level. Here we are brought into what seems like a hotel or office building with several people in the room.<br>
                <br>
                10. I followed the signs to the furnace room which was again the target shown on my card.<br>
                <br>
                11. Here, I found a hammer and some sort of spray.<br>
                <br>
                12. There was a door with a lock on it so I sprayed the lock and hit it with the hammer in order to open it.<br>
                <br>
                13. Once in the furnace room I found another briefcase which granted me a camera and the new task to photograph 5 birds.<br>
                <br>
                14. I continued to multiple rooms with two locks that were dealt with as before. Inside there were birds and when I took a picture of them they jumped down and exploded.<br>
                <br>
                15. To reach some of the final rooms, there was a section where I had to jump across several flag poles and pipes (I died here but simply had to return to my previous save near one of the birds).<br>
                <br>
                16. Upon returning to the starting room and pressing the button for the exit, the single woman left in the room shot me, took my camera, and proceeded to run away, jumping out of the window.<br>
                <br>
                17. I then chased the woman through the window and accross some platforms over to a tunnel with trains running through it.<br>
                <br>
                18. Had to wait for trains to pass by moving over to the side of the platform before proceeding further.<br>
                <br>
                19. Continued to follow the woman until we left the building.<br>
                <br>
                20. The woman shot me and I fell off the railing for the building, having several flashbacks as I fall down to the ground.<br>
                <br>
                21. End the game by pressing 'y' on the keyboard.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                How does the allowed interaction keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches?<br>
                 - By having limited movement and a pretty small play area, the game keeps the player close to where they are supposed to be in order to accomplish their tasks.
                 This makes sure that the player can't get easily lost when trying to discover how they should accomplish any given task.
                 Variations and branches are achieved by allowing the player to move freely within the map and explore wherever is accessible.<br>
                <br>
                Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story:<br>
                 - The game has pretty simple, blocky graphics. I found that this made the game more mysterious because other characters don't show emotion in ways that they might if the game had a more realistic art style.
                 These graphics also serve as a backdrop for the tasks and story that the player is playing through with the simplicity not distracting from the gameplay.<br>
                <br>
                Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels:<br>
                 - The interaction in this game is pretty simple, just involving moving and jumping along with using several items in the second level. I found that the only real interaction I had with the game was when using the spray and hammer to open locks.
                 This plus the small jumping section in the second level really required some interaction from the player while most of the first level was just walking around and pressing 'e' a couple times.
                 Because of this, I felt that the interaction didn't influence much of the choices or emotions of the player.<br>
